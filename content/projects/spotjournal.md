A music-based journaling hackathon project
<!--more-->
## Background
I signed up for HackDuke 2020 with some random teammates. We chose the Health track, and decided to make an application that would help identify songs that gave people certain emotions. We played a random song from the user's previously listened to songs on Spotify, and had them fill out a form before and after listening to it, tracking their mood changes. Afterwards, users can view how others reacted to the same song.
## Technologies

SpotJournal is built using the following technologies:
* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)
* [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
* [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/)
* [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/)
