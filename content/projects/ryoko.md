A website that helps users find the perfect location for their next home or apartment
<!--more-->
## Background
Ryoko is a website designed to determine the best places to live. It has a comparison tool that allows users to input a list of homes/apartments they are looking at and the places they travel throughout the week. For each place they commute to, they can input the frequency they go there and the mode of travel (driving, walking, etc.)


Then, users can generate metrics for each home/apartment to see which one they like best based on the ease of travel, time spent traveling, and the total distance traveled per week. Ryoko also has a city finder tool to search the most popular U.S. cities by preferences, including total population, population density, and distance from a set of given coordinates.

## Technologies

Ryoko is built using the following technologies:
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)
* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/)
* [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

**Powered by:**
* [Walk Score API](https://www.walkscore.com/professional/api.php) for ease of travel data
* [Google Maps API](https://developers.google.com/maps) for distance and time traveled metrics 
* [simplemaps](https://simplemaps.com/data/us-cities) for city information
